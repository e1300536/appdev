This project is to turn a Raspberry PI as an audio capture device. The device will be able to 
collect sound and create a test tone, and create a visual bargraph of the data.

1.Configuration Instructions

This application is created and run on Raspberry pi B+ 1.2.
To run the application, a microphone and a network connection are required.

1.1 Configure USB sound card as default audio device

1.	RPi onboard sound card does not have a microphone interface. We have to change the default audio device to be a USB sound card. 

2.	Boot up RPi, and apply the USB sound card. Use .lsusb. command to check if your USB sound card is mounted:
	pi@raspberrypi:~ $ lsusb
	Bus 001 Device 004: ID 0d8c:000c C-Media Electronics, Inc. Audio Adapter
	Bus 001 Device 003: ID 0424:ec00 Standard Microsystems Corp. SMSC9512/9514 Fast Ethernet Adapter
	Bus 001 Device 002: ID 0424:9514 Standard Microsystems Corp.
	Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub

3.	Use .sudo nano /etc/asound.conf.command and put following content to the file:
	pcm.!default
	{
	  type plug
	    slave 
	    {
	      pcm "hw:1,0"
	  }
	}
	ctl.!default {
	    type hw
	    card 1
	}

4.	Go to your home directory. Use .nano .asoundrc. command and put the same code on the file.

5.	Run .alsamixer. you should be able to see that USB sound card is the default audio device. You should maximize the volume of Mic for better sound capture rate.

1.2 Install Libcurl library

1.	First use command "ls /usr/include/curl" or "ls /usr/include/arm-linux-gnueabihf/curl" to identify that libcurl library is installed.

2.	If the folder doesn't exist, run "sudo apt-get update" to update the application list.

3.	Run "sudo apt-get install libcurl3" to install the libcurl3.

4.	Run "sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev" to install the development API of libcurl4.

2. Installation instructions

2.1 SD-card preparation

1.	Get a laptop/desktop PC with SD-card slot.

2.	Insert micro-SD card into SD-card adapter. The adapter is in the same package as micro-SD card.
 
3.	Insert SD-card adapter into the SD-card slot of your PC or card-reader. The system will inform you a USB storage device is available.

4.	Go to website: https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/noobs/ and download .Noobs. image.

5.	Open two Windows Explorer windows. Window 1 goes to your "Download" folder and open the ZIP file "NOOBS_v3_0_0.zip".
 
6.	The 2nd Explorer window is located to your SD-card. Usually it is D:, E: or F: drive, depending on your system partition.

7.	Copy everything from Explorer Window 1 to Window 2. This may take a few minutes.

8.	Once copy is complete, verify that two Explorer windows have the same content.
 
9.	Remove the USB device (SD-card) safely from your PC system.

Required software:
	RPi files (RPi)
	Server files (Server)
	PuTTy

3.Operating Instructions
	
1.	Recording 1 second of audio into test.wav file using RPi

2.	Outputting corresponding data in the console window

3.	Header data and list of 80 RMS values ( DEBUG mode)
	Displayed using bar (.) symbol ( UNICODE mode)
	Displayed using asterisk ( * ) symbol ( non-UNICODE mode)

4.	#define DEBUG // Conditional compiling
	UNICODE / non-UNICODE mode
	The UNICODE constant is defined in screen.h. In order to set it off / on, add / remove two slashes (//) respectively in the beginning of the following line:

5.	#define UNICODE // Conditional compiling
	COMM / non-COMM mode
	The COMM constant is defined in comm.h. In order to set it off / on, add / remove two slashes (//) respectively in the beginning of the following line:

6.	#define DEBUG // Conditional compiling
	Setting the servers URL address on the RPi side
	When COMM mode is set, one should change the URL address in comm.h file in the following line:

7.	#define URL "http://your.server.com/.../sound.php"
	Launching
	Launch the RPi

8.	Connect to the RPi via PuTTY

9.	Make the object files and the sound.a application,
	~$ make
	
10.	Run the program,
	~$ ./sound.out

11.	Go to the server's URL in the browser on the MOC
	In order to stop the program, press Ctrl + C in the PuTTY console window.
